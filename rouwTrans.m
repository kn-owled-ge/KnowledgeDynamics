% ROUWTRANS:
%    Construct transition probability matrix for discretizing an AR(1) process
% This procedure is from Rouwenhorst (1995) which can calibrate an extremely
% persistent AR(1) process that Tauchen and Hussey (1991) procedure cannot handle
% 
% USAGE:
%   rho - persistent level of the process (close to one)
%   ave - mean serving as the middle point of the discrete state space
%   dev - step size of the even-spaced grid 
%   num - num of grid point on the discretized process
% 
% OUTPUT:
%   dscSp  - discrete state space (num by 1 vector)
%   transP - transition probability matrix over the grid with sum(transP) == 1
%        
% NOTES: 
%   (1) How to pick rho and dev to match an AR(1) with persistence rho and conditional
%       volatility sigma? First, rho is itself. That's easy. Now consider the choice of dev.
%       Rouwenhorst (1995) shows that the unconditional volatility of discrete process is: 
%         
%                                epsilon/sqrt(num - 1) 
% 
%       where epsilon is from [ave - epsilon ave + epsilon] the grid
%       interval (now you see why num has to be an odd number so as to keep the interval symmetric 
%       around ave!). Next, using the following two facts: (i) epsilon = (num - 1)/2 *dev and (ii)
%       conditional volatility = unconditional volatility * sqrt(1 - rho^2), I have the cook recipe:
% 
%               dev = 2*sigma^{cond} /sqrt((1 - rho^2)*(num - 1))
%       
%   (2) To go from quarterly rho_q and sigma_q (conditional volatility) to monthly counterparts,
%       simply do:      rho_m = rho_q^(1/4)    and sigma_m = sigma_q/4
%       where the latter equality follows since conditional shocks are IID by definition
